# Hi, I am Ercan CANLIER
This is my personal digital garden and second brain to write out things 
that i have found out how to do and share with others. All opinions expressed here are 
solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of others.

# Who am i?
I am a passionate software engineer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. 
I examine the consequences, identify the best solutions and put that solutions into practice. 
I believe being passionate is key to success that requires dedication, determination and discipline.
